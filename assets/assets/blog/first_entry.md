# Here I go, again on my own

> -- pampanet.org, May 25th 2024

It's been a while since I don't post and this is the first post in my own website, so I'm pretty excited to see the outcome of this new experience.

So, without further ado, this is the first post of pampanet.org

## Our Mission

Since the software industry is in continuous change, **it's not always clear to tell if our culture is really** transforming for the better and the common wealth, or in simpler terms, **evolving**. 

So this company's focus and mission is to **make software that can help us evolve**, always finding new challenges while focusing on giving the best user experience today.


## Our Products

### Mulita: File Archiver

In 2024, pampanet.org has focused on releasing a multi-platform file archiver, to bring back the experience of browsing the contents of a zip file without wondering if there's enough disk space and choosing which files to extract like in the good old days. 
Since the app is multi-platform, the backend has to be as robust and efficient as it can be so it's going to rely on native technologies using Foreign Function Interfacing (a.k.a. FFI) to provide high speeds for operating with files.

The company will release free and premium versions for iOS and Android, but also target desktop platforms such as Windows, MacOS and Linux.

### BLE Serial Console

Back in 2018, I released an application to interact with bluetooth breakout boards for arduino as part of a pet project. Since then, the app has had more than 5k installs and counted with several hundreds of active users.

The application had the following features:

- Connect to a BLE device
- Browse a BLE device services and characteristics
- Subscribe to a BLE GATT Characteristic for updates
- Send and receive information using [AT commands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayes_AT_command_set)
- Provide a serial terminal/console to communicate with HM-10 BLE Modules
- BLE Module distance estimation using RSSI Kalman filtering (in beta)

The company will continue the development of this product during 2024 providing support for android and expanding this support to other platforms as well.
