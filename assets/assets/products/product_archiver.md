> Multi-Platform File Archiver

In Computer Science, the term "archive" refers to a compressed folder or a set of files.
Pampanet's Archiver purpose is to allow users view the contents of an archive without extracting the whole file in a temporary storage first.

## Features

This app allows users to:

- Browse an archive
- Determine the entry's Mime-Type (`text/plain`, `image/png`, etc) beforehand to avoid opening unwanted files.
- Create new entries (add files)
- Remove existing entries (remove files and/or folders)
- Open an individual entry (open a compressed file by extracting only the selected entry in a temporary folder)
- encryption (set password) for the whole archive
- Sort entries by name, type, size
